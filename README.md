# shell

This is a custom interpreter (bash), which was written in the C language.

[An interpreter is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions written using one of the many high-level programming languages. The interpreter transforms the high-level program into an intermediate language that it then executes, or it could parse the high-level source code and then performs the commands directly, which is done line by line or statement by statement.](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/7793/interpreter)
